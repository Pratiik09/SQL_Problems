-- 1393. Capital Gain/Loss --
-- Initial Approach --
WITH BuyT AS (
    SELECT stock_name, SUM(price) AS BP
    FROM Stocks
    WHERE operation = 'Buy'
    GROUP BY stock_name
    ORDER BY 1 ASC
),
SellT AS (
    SELECT stock_name, SUM(price) AS SP
    FROM Stocks
    WHERE operation = 'Sell'
    GROUP BY stock_name
    ORDER BY 1 ASC    
)
SELECT B.stock_name, (SP-BP) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM BuyT B
JOIN SellT S
ON B.stock_name = S.stock_name

-- Optimzed Approach --
SELECT stock_name, SUM(
    CASE 
        WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
        ELSE price
    END
) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name

-- 176. Second Highest Salary --

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

-- My Approach --
WITH TempA AS (
    SELECT id, salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS DR_S
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN MAX(DR_S) = 1 THEN null
    ELSE salary
END AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM TempA
WHERE DR_S = 2

-- Other Approach --
SELECT IFNULL( 
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL
) AS SecondHighestSalary
